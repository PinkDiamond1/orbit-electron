Desktop App for Orbit.

Built with the following packages:

- [orbit-web](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-web) - UI for the application.
- [orbit-core](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-core) - Core Orbit communication library.
- [orbit-db](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) - Serverless, p2p database that orbit-core uses to store its data.

## Project Status

**Status:** *In active development*

**NOTE!** *Orbit is still more or less experimental. Things will change and break over the coming months, but we're pushing towards to stabilize the code base. If you come across problems, it would help greatly to open issues so that we can fix them as quickly as possible.*

Check the project's [roadmap](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) to see what's happening at the moment and what's planned next.
